# Maintainers wanted!

If you would find this project interesting, feel free to contact me to take over maintenance. Sadly, I have no spare time to work on it myself.


## Note

This app has been in development for a few years a side project of mine for learning Android, so the code definitely has it's warts here and there. Pull request or suggestions for code clean-ups greatly appreciated.
